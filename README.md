 👋 Hi, I’m @zbyte-prog
 
 👀 I’m interested in ... everything the IOT has to offer. Currently I'm researching Internet Security because I have not only had issues getting into my other 
 Github account, but also I have been hacked by someone close to me several times. Needless to say I want to get ahead of the curve and try to do my part for the 
 Collective and do the research to improve Internet Security and help make it more accessible and understandable for the masses, and just protect my own data.
 
 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to code by teaching myself.
 
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... and all repositories and with anyone that wants to help with my projects and vice verse. I love acquireing knowledege to help
 myself and others. So if you have something you want to share feel free and ask or send.
